# cse-163final

This folder includes functions.py which writes the function of my first four questions and call functions, and machine_learning.py which writes the function of my fifth question and calls the function. And test.py which writes all my functional tests.
You need to install the python environment, and click the two links I mentioned in the report data set part to enter the link to download the two data sets. Then you should open my code file, import dataset.
You should then run functions.py with this, as well as machine_learning.py, and then run test.py to see the accuracy of the results.
